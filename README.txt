Game Overview
Beat King is a one key rhythm game set in a musical medieval world. 
You are a lone knight who sets out on a quest to beat their enemies after witnessing the death of your father. 
To progress through each level, you must click an attack key whenever the enemy aligns with your crosshair, 
which aligns with the melody of each level’s song.

Unfinished Features: A list of any proposed ideas or mechanics that weren’t completed.
- Visual Synchronization: A scene to calibrate audio and visual delay, and adjust to counteract them. Such scenes can be found in games like Rock Band or Guitar Hero.

Future Improvements
- A utility tool to convert MIDI files into SongSO objects would make charting much faster.
- Cutscenes need much more work, such as allowing characters to change sprites or have transformations applied on the screen.
